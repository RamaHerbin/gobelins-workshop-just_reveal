# WORKSHOP - JUST REVEAL - GOBELINS Paris 
In partnership with the [AFP news agency](https://www.afp.com/en)

Our goal was to create an interactive cartography on the major events during the COVID-19 pandemic 2020-2022 period.
Our team decided to focus on the positive events that may happened during that time.
